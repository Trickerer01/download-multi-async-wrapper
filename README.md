This is an engine that asynchronously processes basically different r34 downloaders cmdlines. Cmdline composition is based on a simple syntax which allows to form series of cmdlines progressively and process multiple queries without causing duplicates  

Ruxx, RV and NM downloaders are all supported  
Refer to `SCRIPTING_SYNTAX.txt` for script composition guidelines  
`main.py --help` to see config arguments
